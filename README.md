This group project included the use of the Programming Language C++ and the objective was to incorporate several elements such as the use of multiple files, ADT (Abstract Data Type), functionalities such as Edit, Delete and Add with search operations in a dynamic array structure with the use of classes and structures. To incorporate all this into codes, we decided to make the program a fun and enjoyable one as we decided to make a snake and ladder game to encompass how the fucntionality of the codes work as a whole.
